         <h1>About Thor</h1>
        <p>Thor (Old Norse: Þórr) is the Norse god of thunder, the sky, and agriculture.</p>
           <p>He is the son of Odin, chief of the gods, and Odin's consort Jord (Earth)<br>
             and husband of the fertility goddess Sif, who is the mother of his son Modi<br>
             and daughter Thrud; his other son, Magni, may be from a union with the<br> 
             giantess Jarnsaxa.</p>
           <p>Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of<br>
            the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania,<br> 
            to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity<br>
            during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization<br>
            of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, Mjölnir, were worn and Norse pagan<br>
            personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are<br>
                 only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology.<br>
                  Norse mythology, largely recorded in Iceland from traditional material stemming<br>
                   from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god.<br>
                    In these sources, Thor bears at least fifteen names, is the husband of the<br> golden-haired goddess Sif,
                     is the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa, and is generally described <br>as fierce eyed,
                     with red hair and red beard.[1] With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess <br>
                     (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with<br>
                      a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, and he is the stepfather<br>
                       of the god Ullr. By way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers, including Baldr.<br>
                        Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats,<br>
                         Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three <br>
        dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the hammer Mjölnir, wears<br>
the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr.<br></p>
